# DUAL INPUT VIDEO - SCRIPT NEEDED FOR THIS 

Placing this in this folder for now so I don't have to worry about dependency issues, although it will likely be cleaned up in later sprints. This script will capture both the RGB and Thermal Camera videos at the same time, saving both outputs of the thermal camera. This data will then be saved to a common directory with timestamps when saved.
