#deepSORT supposedly very fast tracker

#looks as though slowest option out of here is CRF for a full pipeline

#best combo would be strong detection model,  so production of object centers or contours
#then combining these detections with deepSORT technology or concepts, suggesting 30fps calcuations can be good
#if we wanted to go to lower fps CRF is recommended
