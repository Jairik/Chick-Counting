# Chick-Counting Project
Under contract with Salisbury University and Perdue Farms, we plan on developing a highly accurate image-recognition ML algorithm to predict the number of chicks dropping off of a converyor belt. We plan to utilize custom hardware for data collection, an optimized image detection algorithm in the backend, and a developer & user-friendly frontend for the client.
