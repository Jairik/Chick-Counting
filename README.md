# Raspberry Pi Branch

Will hold the resources and code needed for the raspberry pi, attempting to reduce the size of files needed to be cloned.

The main data collection script is under input-gathering/example/DUAL_VIDEO_CAPTURE, being in this hierchy due to dependency concerns. Once a completely working model is up and functional, I plan to clean up this branch so it only includes the necessary scripts. For now, however, every file is here for testing.
