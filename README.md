# Chick-Counting Project

Under contract with Salisbury University and Perdue Farms, we plan on developing a highly accurate image-recognition ML algorithm to predict the number of chicks dropping off of a converyor belt. We plan to utilize custom hardware for data collection, an optimized image detection algorithm in the backend, and a developer & user-friendly frontend for the client.

## Workflow

Completing the project in a scrum-based environment, meeting as a team twice a week and with the client once a week to plan our sprints and assign spikes/tasks.
