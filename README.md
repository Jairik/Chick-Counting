# Chick-Counting Project
Under contract with Salisbury University and Perdue Farms, we plan on developing a highly accuracy image-recognition ML algorithm that can accurately predict the number of chicks passing through the plant. We plan to utilize custom hardware for data collection, an optimized image detection algorithm in the backend, and a developer & user-friendly frontend for the client.
